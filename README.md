# $FOSSR - Fall of Solana Strategic Reserve

The only coin that was built to be rug proof and bot or sniper resistant.

## Features

- **Tiered Protective Locks**: Lock duration based on purchase size and holdings. The more you buy and hold, the less time your tokens are locked for.
- **Randomized Airdrops to Holders**: Every 5 minutes any account holding over 10k FOSSR is eligible for an Airdrop based on the transaction fees from the previous 5 minutes.
- **100% Fair Launch**: 0% team allocation, full transparency   *The few airdrops that do happen in the beginning are from my personal wallet to community members that helped with the Beta testing.
- **Deflationary Tokenomics**: 0.069% burn on every transaction

### Randomness

Right now this is Version 1.0 so the entropy used for randomness is blockhash based, decent but not perfect. If this token does well enough ill spend the extra time and money to upgrade to chainlink or switchboard.

## Disclaimer

This is experimental software. The goal is to gamify are reward holding, while making it unprofitable for bots and snipers. 
Do not be mad if you get a time lock of one hour, while your friend only got 10 minutes. The randomness is a feature not a bug.
